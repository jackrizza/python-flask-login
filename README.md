# Python log in
this project was created with the intention of learning. it is written with python and uses:

- [redis](http://redis.io/)
- [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
- [furtive](http://furtive.co/)

This project was intended to be edicational. I hope to port it out for different databases and make it capable to use public/private keys so that it can be a sign in on a different server. The different databases I want to fork the code for is:
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- RethinkDB
- memcached
- couchDB
- mongoDB
